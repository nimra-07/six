✅ PHASE 1: Launch & Prepare EC2 Instance
Step 1: Launch EC2
Go to AWS Console → Search EC2 → Open Instances.

Click Launch Instance or choose an existing instance.

Choose Ubuntu AMI (or Amazon Linux if preferred).

Choose t2.micro for Free Tier.

In Key Pair, select an existing key or create a new one:

Download the .pem file when prompted. Save it securely.

Step 2: Configure Network Access
Under Security Group settings:

Ensure Port 22 (SSH) is open to your IP.

This is necessary to connect via SSH.

In Inbound Rules:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Type: SSH
Port: 22
Source: My IP
Launch the instance.

After it's running, copy the Public IPv4 address.

✅ PHASE 2: Set Up SSH Access on Ubuntu
Step 3: Move .pem to .ssh Folder
Open Ubuntu Terminal.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
mv ~/Downloads/your-key.pem ~/.ssh/
Replace your-key.pem with the name of the .pem file you downloaded.

Step 4: Set Secure Permissions
SSH requires strict permissions on the private key:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/your-key.pem
Step 5 (Optional but Recommended): Create SSH Config File
Open or create the SSH config file:

bash
Copy
Edit
nano ~/.ssh/config
Add this block:

ini
Copy
Edit
Host my-ec2
  HostName <your-ec2-public-ip>
  User ubuntu                     # For Ubuntu AMI
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your-key.pem
Replace <your-ec2-public-ip> with the actual public IPv4 address.

Save and exit: Ctrl + O, then Enter, then Ctrl + X.

✅ PHASE 3: Connect Using VS Code
Step 6: Install Remote - SSH Extension in VS Code
Open VS Code.

Go to Extensions (Ctrl + Shift + X).

Search for Remote - SSH and install it.

Step 7: Connect to EC2 from VS Code
Open Command Palette: Ctrl + Shift + P.

Type and select:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Remote-SSH: Connect to Host
Select my-ec2 from the list (from your ~/.ssh/config).

VS Code will:

Open a new window.

Automatically connect to your EC2 terminal.

✅ You can now open folders, run code, install packages on EC2 from inside VS Code!

✅ (Alternative) PHASE 4: Connect Without Config File
If you don't want to use ~/.ssh/config, connect directly via terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-public-ip>
But you’ll need to do this every time. The config file avoids repetition.

✅ PHASE 5: (Optional) Setup Git & Tools on EC2
You can now install dev tools on EC2 for full-stack remote dev:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git build-essential nodejs npm python3-pip -y
✅ ✅ Summary of What You Need:
Task	Detail
EC2 Instance	Launched and running
.pem file	Saved in ~/.ssh/ with permission 400
VS Code Extension	Remote - SSH
~/.ssh/config (optional)	Easy nickname-based connection
Final Command (if needed)	ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ubuntu@ip
